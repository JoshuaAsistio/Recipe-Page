### Links

- Github repository: [Recipe Page Repository](https://github.com/JoshuaAsistio/Recipe-Page)
- Live Site URL: [Recipe Page Live Site](https://recipe-page-t6f1.onrender.com/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I undertook this project with only one goal in mind: to be able to apply what I've learned about Tailwind. I have found styling websites using Tailwind a lot easier than writing your own CSS. This is probably the css library that is closest to writing your own css, except that you can do it without leaving your HTML code.

### Continued development

In the future, I could see this recipe page be integrated into a bigger website like a cooking website.

### Useful resources

- Paint3D - I don't have access to the figma design itself so having Paint3D really helped me a lot. I was able to measure how big the font sizes are for different texts, measure the padding and width, and find out what clors were used using the eye picker tool.
